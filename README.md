# BitBot: The Bitcoin Trading Robot
**Goal**: To grow an initial investment of **0.1 Bitcoin** into **1 Bitcoin** using a multi-model, automated trading strategy.

## Project Overview
**BitBot** is an automated Bitcoin trading bot designed to execute trades across different timeframes and market conditions. It utilizes multiple machine learning models trained on specific timeframes (1-minute, 15-minute, 1-hour, 1-day, and 1-month) to identify patterns unique to micro, mid, swing, and trend data. A meta-model, or "super model," combines predictions from these individual models to make final trading decisions. The bot integrates with a trading API (such as Alpaca) for live trading and generates performance reports to track progress toward the project's goal.

## Features
- **Timeframe-Specific Models**: Specialized models for short-term (1-min, 15-min), mid-term (1-hour), swing (1-day), and trend (1-month) data.
- **Meta Model for Decision-Making**: A super model that combines outputs from individual models to make ensemble trading decisions.
- **Automated Execution**: Seamless integration with Alpaca (or another broker API) to place trades automatically.
- **Performance Tracking**: Logs all trades, model outputs, and performance metrics for real-time monitoring and reporting.
- **Risk Management**: Configurable stop-loss, take-profit, and portfolio exposure limits.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- Install project dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 1. Settings Management
The **Settings Cell** centralizes all configurations for BitBot, including input/output paths, configurable settings, and document lists. This makes it easy to adjust paths, specify data sources, and verify which files are active in the session.

### 2. Data Collection and Review Process
   - **Purpose**: Collect historical Bitcoin data for various timeframes and store it in a structured, reviewable format.
   - **Function**: The data collection function gathers Bitcoin data on a month-by-month basis, allowing for periodic review.
   - **Monthly & Year-End Review**: After collecting monthly data, it prompts for review before saving to `bitcoin_data_updated.json`. At the end of each year, it prompts to confirm before saving to `bitcoin_data69.json` (the master ledger).
   - **Safe-guarded Overwrite**: Before updating `bitcoin_data69.json`, the program presents a simple math challenge to confirm the overwrite.

### 3. Model Training
   - **Timeframe Models**: Sequentially train the micro, mid, swing, and trend models, and then train the meta-model to combine predictions from each individual model.
   - **Data Processing**: Use `2_utils/data_processing.py` for feature engineering, and save the processed data in `1_data/processed/` for model training.
   - **Save Location**: Trained models are saved in the `3_models/` directory.

### 4. Troubleshooting Interface
The **Troubleshooting Cell** in the notebook provides an interactive interface for refining individual cells based on actions chosen by the user. The cell prompts for:
- **Document Selection**: Choose which documents are active in the session.
- **Cell Selection**: Choose cell indices and preview content if desired.
- **Action Selection**: Choose an action for each cell, including:
  - **Custom prompt**: Specify any desired custom prompt.
  - **Create New Cell**: Generates a new cell based on project objectives.
  - **Modify Cell**: Refines and optimizes code within the cell.
  - **Create Documentation**: Adds detailed comments and documentation for clarity.
- **Execution**: Runs the `troubleshooter.py` backend to apply changes and save an updated notebook.

The **troubleshooter.py** script manages each stage of cell improvement:
- **Backend Logic**: Functions for loading, saving, and previewing cells.
- **API Integration**: Sends prompts to ChatGPT or Gemini for iterative suggestions.
- **Batch Processing**: Allows processing of multiple cells with selected actions, updating the notebook as specified.

### 5. Logging and Reporting
   - **Logging**: Set up detailed logs in `6_logs/` for trade activity, error messages, and model training history. This provides traceability and helps with debugging.
   - **Reporting**: Regular performance summaries, accuracy metrics, and analytics reports are generated in `7_reports/`, allowing you to monitor progress and refine strategies.

## Workflow and Priority Guide

1. **Settings Management**: Adjust paths, specify settings, and confirm available documents.
2. **Data Collection & Review**: Collect Bitcoin data month-by-month, verify each segment, and save to `bitcoin_data_updated.json`. At year-end, confirm and update `bitcoin_data69.json`.
3. **Model Training**: Train each model and save results in `3_models/`.
4. **Troubleshooting**: Use the interactive notebook cell to refine any code cell based on user-defined actions.
5. **Logging and Reporting**: Monitor and analyze bot activity, model outputs, and trade records.

## Future Enhancements
- **Sentiment Analysis Integration**: Integrate social media sentiment to influence trading decisions based on market sentiment.
- **Market Regime Detection**: Detect different market conditions (bullish, bearish, neutral) and adjust model weights accordingly.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Apply filters for volatility, liquidity, and other factors that dynamically adjust the trading strategy.
