# BitBot: The Bitcoin Trading Robot
**Goal**: To grow an initial investment of **0.1 Bitcoin** into **1 Bitcoin** using a multi-model, automated trading strategy.

## Project Overview
**BitBot** is an automated trading bot designed to execute high-probability Bitcoin trades across different market conditions. It utilizes multiple specialized machine learning models trained on various timeframes (1-minute, 15-minute, 1-hour, 1-day, and 1-month) to capture unique patterns in micro, mid, swing, and trend data. A meta-model, or "super model," orchestrates these individual models’ insights, generating informed buy/sell/hold signals. BitBot connects to a trading API, like Alpaca, for live, automated trading and continuously generates performance reports to track progress toward the project’s ultimate goal.

## Features
- **Timeframe-Specific Models**: Specialized models tailored for short-term (1-min, 15-min), mid-term (1-hour), swing (1-day), and long-term trend (1-month) data.
- **Meta Model for Decision-Making**: An ensemble super model that combines outputs from individual models to make trading decisions.
- **Automated Execution**: Seamlessly integrates with Alpaca (or another broker API) to place trades automatically.
- **Performance Tracking**: Logs all trades, model outputs, and overall performance metrics for real-time monitoring and reporting.
- **Risk Management**: Customizable stop-loss, take-profit, and exposure limits to manage portfolio risk.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Models and Training
### 1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Collect historical Bitcoin price data in `data/historical/`.
   - Preprocess data to include technical indicators like RSI, MACD, moving averages, using `data_processing.py`.

### 2. **Training Each Model**
   - **Micro Models** (1-min, 15-min): Optimized for short-term patterns; trained in `models/micro_model/`.
   - **Mid Model** (1-hour): Captures hourly trends; trained in `models/mid_model/`.
   - **Swing Model** (1-day): Tracks daily price fluctuations; trained in `models/swing_model/`.
   - **Trend Model** (1-month): Detects long-term trends; trained in `models/trend_model/`.

### 3. **Meta Model (Super Model)**
   - Combines predictions from individual models to generate an ensemble decision.
   - The meta model, located in `models/meta_model/`, uses ensemble learning methods like stacking or dynamic weighting.

### 4. **Backtesting**
   - Run backtests on various historical data segments to simulate different market conditions.
   - Track performance metrics (accuracy, Sharpe ratio, drawdown) to validate each model’s effectiveness.

## Running BitBot
### 1. **API Configuration**
   - Obtain API keys from Alpaca or a similar platform.
   - Add API keys to `config.py`.

### 2. **Setting Up Risk Management**
   - Define risk parameters (stop-loss, max drawdown, etc.) in `config.py` for effective portfolio protection.

### 3. **Starting the Bot**
   ```bash
   python bot/trading_bot.py
   ```
   - The bot will automatically execute trades based on ensemble model predictions and log results.

### 4. **Monitoring and Reports**
   - All trade activity is logged in `logs/`, with periodic performance reports generated for review.

## Future Improvements
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporate social media sentiment analysis to detect market mood shifts.
- **Dynamic Market Regime Adjustment**: Enhance the super model to adjust ensemble weights based on current market conditions (bullish, bearish, neutral).
- **Volatility and Liquidity Filters**: Integrate filters to adjust trading strategies dynamically based on market liquidity and volatility.

## Disclaimer
This project is a proof-of-concept, intended for research purposes. **Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile**—use caution, and thoroughly test in a paper trading environment before deploying with real capital.
