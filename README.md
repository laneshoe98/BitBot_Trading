First, identify the dream data.
Second, get realistic
Third, aproximate the dream data anyways
Fourth, format and split dream data into 3 sections
    Sections 1 and 2 are for training (80%)
    Section 3 is for testing (20%)
Fifth, run analytics on the data
    Supervised learning Techniques
        Continuous (Regression techniques)
            Start with linear Regression
            Move on to regularized regression
                Ridge Regression
                Lasso Regression
        Classification (Classification techniques)
            Start with Logistic Regression
            Move on to tree based models
                Random Forests
                Gradient Boosting
    Unsupervised learning Techniques
        Grouping Data Points (Clustering Technique)
            Start with K-Means Clustering
                Move on to Hierachical CLustering
                DBSCAN
                HMM? 
        Reducing Features (Dimensionality Reduction Technique)
            Start with Principlal Component Analysis (PCA)
                Move on to T-SNE for data visualization
                Or use Topic Modeling Techniques for text data
