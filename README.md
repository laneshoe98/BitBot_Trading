# Automated Stock Trading and Growth Analysis Bot

## Overview
This project aims to build a sophisticated trading robot capable of analyzing the growth cycles of approximately 3,000 mid-cap to mega-cap companies. The robot focuses on capturing insights about how companies evolve through different market caps and growth phases, from early stages to conglomerates. By modeling price action and identifying unique cases—such as NVIDIA, a semiconductor company with growth tech behaviors—the project provides insights that enable:

- **Short-term trades** executed by the robot, typically held for less than a year.
- **Long-term investments** managed through in-depth data analysis, held for more than a year.

The goal is to apply and test 4 to 10 trading strategies across various stock sets, with some overlap, creating a robust framework for understanding different market dynamics.

## Features
1. **Financial Data Collection**
   - Gather detailed financial and stock data on 3,000+ mid-cap and above companies.
   - Store data for long-term analysis and modeling of growth phases.

2. **Growth Cycle Modeling**
   - Analyze how companies transition through growth phases, capturing distinctions between:
      - Mid-cap to mega-cap growth
      - Pivot strategies at significant size thresholds (e.g., companies reaching $500 billion+ market cap)
   - Identify unique behaviors, such as semiconductors that follow tech growth patterns.

3. **Multi-Strategy Trading**
   - Implement and test multiple trading strategies (4-10) based on:
      - Price action trends
      - Company growth cycles
      - Sector-specific cycles and macroeconomic indicators
   - Apply overlapping and independent strategies across various stock sets.

4. **Short-Term and Long-Term Strategy Integration**
   - **Robot-Managed Trades**: Execute trades lasting under a year, using high-frequency signals and data.
   - **User-Managed Investments**: Identify long-term investment opportunities, driven by growth cycle analysis.
